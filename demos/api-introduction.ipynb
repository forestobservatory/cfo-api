    "\n",
    "This notebook is running in the cfo `conda` environment. We created this simple environment to include a series of useful geospatial/data science packages we use on a regular basis (`gdal`, `otb`, `geopandas`, `sklearn`, etc.). If you have conda [installed](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/), you can run the following to run this notebook:\n",

    "\n",
    "- Searching for data\n",
    "- Downloading data\n",
    "- Loading web maps\n",

    "You'll need a CFO account to run everything in this notebook. Sign up at [forestobservatory.com](https://forestobservatory.com).\n",

    "### A note on cloud data storage\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook review how to download the data using Salo Science's API. But if you want to skip the middle man (erm, the middle alien) you can find the data on our publicly-accessible Google Cloud Storage Bucket ([link here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/cfo-public)). If you use `gsutil`, you can access the data via the `gs://cfo-public` bucket)"
